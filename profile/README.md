## About

**Cenzero** is an open-source initiative focused on building modern, modular, and intuitive tools for web developers — starting with [`cnzr`](https://github.com/CenZero/cnzr), a minimal yet powerful web framework built in TypeScript.

Our mission is to create developer-centric tools with:
- **Scalable architecture**
- **Modern DX** (developer experience)

We’re inspired by projects like Express, Hono, Fastify, and Next.js — but with our own philosophy: **cleaner structure, better defaults, and built for real-world apps.**

## Philosophy

- **Build less, ship more.**
